I am a postdoctoral researcher at the information security unit in the
department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Chalmers and
the University of Gothenburg.  My research interests include formal
methods for modeling and verifying complex systems, type systems and
type theory, and the design and semantics of domain-specific
languages.  In the past, I spent my time pondering the soundness of
the Scala type system.  These days, I'm busy applying formal methods
and type theory to problems in privacy and security, and hacking type
soundness proofs in Agda.

From 2018 to 2020 I was a postdoc at the formal methods division at
Chalmers.  I obtained my PhD from EPFL in 2016, after working as a
doctoral assistant at LAMP (the "Scala group") under the supervision
of Martin Odersky.
