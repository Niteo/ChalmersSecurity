  Gerardo Schneider â€”
  Is Privacy by Construction Possible?
teaser: |-
  Finding suitable ways to handle personal data in conformance with
  the law is challenging. The European General Data Protection
  Regulation (GDPR), enforced since May 2018, makes it mandatory to
  citizens and companies to comply with the privacy requirements set
  in the regulation. For existing systems the challenge is to be able
  to show evidence that they are already complying with the GDPR, or
  otherwise to work towards compliance by modifying their systems and
  procedures, or alternatively reprogramming their systems in order to
  pass the eventual controls. For those starting new projects the
  advice is to take privacy into consideration since the very
  beginning, already at design time. This has been known as Privacy by
  Design (PbD). The main question is how much privacy can you
  effectively achieve by using PbD, and in particular whether it is
  possible to achieve Privacy by Construction. In this short
  non-technical talk I will give my personal opinion on issues related
  to the ambition of achieving Privacy by Construction.
