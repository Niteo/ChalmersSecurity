  Deepak Garg —
  CoVault: Facilitating highly secure, high-stakes data analytics
teaser: |-
  The recent Covid-19 pandemic has shown that individuals’ whereabouts
  and social contact data can be very effective in understanding a new
  infectious disease in a timely manner. However, due to the
  privacy-sensitive nature of such data, liberal societies have
  hesitated to even collect such data. Part of the problem is the lack
  of technology for securely storing and querying such data in the
  presence of extremely strong adversaries (e.g., state-sponsored
  adversaries).
  
  This talk will present the design of CoVault, a work-in-progress
  system for securely storing and querying data under a very strong
  threat model that doesn’t place trust in any one entity or
  authority, and includes the complete compromise of all CPUs of a
  specific manufacturer, as well as many common side channel
  attacks. This threat model transcends prior work on database
  security. Technically, CoVault relies on state-of-the-art trusted
  execution environments, secret sharing and secure multi-party
  computation. While this combination is expensive in terms of
  computational power, we believe that this design point is worth
  exploring for applications like epidemic studies where security is
  non-negotiable, but the returns for society are extremely high.
