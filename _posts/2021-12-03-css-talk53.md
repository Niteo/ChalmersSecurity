  Nachiappan Valliappan —
  Retrofitting Impure Languages with Static Information-Flow Control
teaser: |-
  How can we write secure programs in a pervasively effectful
  language? In a “pure” language, such as Haskell, effects performed
  by a program are recorded explicitly in its type. Thus, a function
  of type `Int -> Int` is just that: a function that receives an
  integer and returns an integer. It does not perform side effects
  such as writing to or reading from a channel. In an impure language,
  such as ML, however, a function of type `Int -> Int` may read,
  write, or even order a burrito. It’s impossible to assert that a
  function is secure from its type alone, since it may be performing
  invisible side effects that may leak a secret. For this reason,
  standard approaches to enforcing static Information-Flow Control
  (IFC)—be it fine-grained or coarse-grained—are not readily
  applicable to impure languages since they require a complete
  reimplementation of the compiler and significant ingenuity from the
  programmer to restructure programs to conform to the new enforcement
  paradigm.
  
  So should we all just switch to Haskell? While I would never
  discourage anybody from doing that, this talk is about developing
  the foundations for retrofitting impure languages with static IFC at
  a much lower cost. In a recent result, Choudhury and Krishnaswami
  [1] show how purity can be recovered in an impure language by using
  capabilities and a special “modal” type operator. In this informal
  talk, I’ll show how their observations, in combination with recent
  advances in formulating modal types, pave the way towards the goal
  of this work.
