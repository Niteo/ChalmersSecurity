title: "Fuzz Testing Automotive Systems - Process and Practice"
teaser: "This presentation provides an introduction to fuzz testing of automotive systems with a focus on both process and practical topics. We first discuss the typical automotive development process to better understand where the fuzz testing activity fits into the overall process. We also discuss common practical pitfalls and challenges when performing fuzz testing of automotive systems. Based on this understanding, a few examples of how fuzz testing can be performed in practice, including how to build a fuzz testing environment for automotive systems, are explained. Last, we also explore how to perform continuous fuzz testing using automated tools and virtual ECUs as part of a CI/CD pipeline."
