  Adwait Nadkarni â€”
  Building Practical Security Systems for the Post-app Smart Home
teaser: |-
  Modern commodity computing platforms such as smartphones (e.g.,
  Android and iOS) and smart home systems (e.g., SmartThings and NEST)
  provide programmable interfaces for third-party integration,
  enabling popular third-party functionality that is often manifested
  in applications, or <em>apps</em>. Thus, for the last decade,
  designing systems to analyze mobile apps for vulnerabilities or
  unwanted behavior has been a major research focus within the
  security community. Leveraging the lessons and techniques learned
  from mobile app analysis, researchers have developed similar systems
  to evaluate the security, safety, and privacy of smart homes by
  inspecting <em>IoT apps</em> developed for platforms such as
  SmartThings. However, emerging characteristics of smart home
  ecosystems indicate the <em>need to move away from the approach of
  IoT app analysis</em>, as IoT apps may not be representative of the
  home automation in real homes, and moreover, be unavailable for
  analysis or instrumentation in the near future.
  
  In this talk, I will describe the challenges for research in the
  backdrop of the unsuitability of IoT apps for practical security
  analysis, and motivate alternate research directions. First, I will
  motivate the need to develop an alternative to IoT apps that is
  representative of automation in the wild, in order to enable a
  practical artifact for building and evaluating security systems for
  smart homes. To this end, I will describe Helion, a system that
  leverages the "user-driven" nature of home automation to generate
  natural home automation scenarios, i.e., realistic event sequences
  that are closely aligned with the real home automation usage in
  end-user homes, which are then used for several critical tasks in
  building and evaluating security systems. Second, I will motivate
  the need to improve the state of security analysis of mobile
  companion apps, which often form the weakest link in IoT ecosystems,
  by systematically and rigorously evaluating the security analyses
  targeted at them. To this end, I will describe how mutation testing
  can be leveraged for empirically evaluating static program
  analysis-based security systems. Our research in this direction has
  led to two mutation frameworks, and the discovery of critical flaws
  in leading tools such as FlowDroid, CryptoGuard, Argus, and Coverity
  that affect the reliability and soundness of their
  analysis. Finally, I will conclude the talk by describing the
  lessons learned from our work, as well as by highlighting challenges
  and opportunities for future research in home automation security.

**Speaker Bio:**\\
[Adwait Nadkarni](https://www.adwaitnadkarni.com/) is an Assistant
Professor in the [Department of Computer
Science](https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/), and director of the
[Secure Platforms Lab (SPL)](https://spl-wm.github.io/) at [William &
Mary](https://www.wm.edu/).  Prof. Nadkarni's primary research domain
is security and privacy, with a focus on emerging platforms, and the
areas of operating systems and software security. His research is
generously supported by the [National Science Foundation
(NSF)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/simpleSearchResult?queryText=%22Adwait+Nadkarni%22)
and the [Commonwealth of Virginia's Cyber Initiative
(CCI)](https://covacci.org/). Prior to joining William & Mary,
Prof. Nadkarni earned his Bachelor of Engineering (BE) in Computer
Engineering from the [University of Mumbai](https://mu.ac.in/) in July
2011, followed by his Ph.D. and M.S. in Computer Science from the
[Computer Science Department](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/) at the [North
Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/) in May 2017 and
December 2012 respectively, both with [Dr. William
Enck](https://www.enck.org/). At NC State, Prof. Nadkarni was a
founding member of the [Wolfpack Security and Privacy Research (WSPR)
Lab](https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu/), and served as its Lead Graduate
Student until May 2017.
