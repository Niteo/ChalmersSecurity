**Abstract:**\\
This talk will give a first overview of research and activities trending in automotive security. We will look at future cooperative vehicle safety systems where cellular communications (i.e., 4G, 5G) and IEEE 802.11p are technologies enabling Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. The talk will focus on security and highlight some attacks and problem areas and motivate why specific and tailored security solutions are necessary in this domain.

We will have a look at real attacks and security problems, current state of automotive security research including the 5G ecosystem, quantum-resistant ciphers, intrusion detection systems and other "hot" research areas in this domain. The talk will be rather general paving the ground for more specific and detailed presentations in this seminar series.
